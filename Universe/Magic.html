        <h2>Description</h2><hr>
        <p>
          The forces that control the world. One who can use magic is called a Viscrable(Visceralis - latin) meaning one who feels deep emotion, derived from the word visceral. There are two different forces behind magic, symbiotic and contrastive. Symbiotic is cooperative, can combine with other symbiotic magic from other wielders.
        </p>

        <h2>Special</h2><hr>
        <h3>Evoke</h3>
        <p>
          To evoke/enervate (haven’t decided) a person’s power means to siphon their power along with the inherent skills and abilities along with it. This can be done through drinking a person’s blood, being gifted with it, or accessing it through a crystal.
        </p>
        <h3>Prophecy</h3>
        <p>A prediction of the future</p>
        <h4>Zephie's prophecies</h4>
        <p>
          Feather of phoenix, all too late (father, since she gave her a phoenix); feather of cloud, for anger abates (Tallie and her dragon taming ability); feather of gold, the dreaded fate. (zephie’s future) Covered in red, the future of dread. Of half and half and half, but not yet whole. (She is from Ace, Sarah, and Sendatsu, but still not having the whole extent of her powers. Dangerous desire to unsheath the hidden blade, once virtuous men will be swayed. Fractured empires, fallen leaders, humbled gods, actions of this shadowed threat. Touch of gentle sunrays perish beneath its feet. Shrouded in red, blood be’n shed, the power unspeakable kindles voracious covet for a force to fulfill fantastical ambitions.

        <h3>Transformation</h3>
        <h4>Controling & behavior</h4>
        <p>
          Often times, a shiftable can struggle to ignore the natural instincts of whatever animal they turn into. A shiftable should use a mental anchor to keep their cognitive awareness; such as a necklace, color of fur/hair, or a familiar location or person.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a complex magic with many things that can go wrong. When a shiftable’s powers are evoked Shiftables have a mid transformation state, often white or another color that can form into the basic shape of the animal they are transforming into until the actual flesh starts forming. Shiftables can stay in their mid transformed state for as long as they want, although for every second they spend in this state they lose a second of memory from the day. If they have been in their state for as long as they've been awake, then the rest of their memory and skills begin to degrade at a faster rate. Shiftables retain their injuries from any form, since the injury is in the subconscious, the injury retains in any form. This can be bypassed by gaining control of the subconscious that is aware of all injuries. This is exceptionally difficult. But if in a volitile and primitive minded form, the injuries can activate primitive instincts on the concoies and subconscious level, depending on injury, pain, and mental instability of the form.
        </p>
        <h4>Training</h4>
        <p>
          Becoming a _shapeshifter takes a deep emotional connection with the animal one wishes to imitate. _shifters use animals as aspects to use an example for transformations. _Shifters often surround themselves with their aspects so they can come to a deeper understanding of the animal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Larger animals are harder to spec. Magical, immortal, and unique animals are also harder, along with animals further away from the human genome, reptiles, insects, non-mammals, ect. Animals that have a long history with humanity are easier; dogs, cats, horses. Animals that are significant to one's culture are easeier, either due to genetics or emotional signficance.
