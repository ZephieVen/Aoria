        <h2>Description</h2><hr>
        <p>
          Ace is a scientist currenty living and working in (insert city name). His healing skills are exceptional and strangely will only accept favors as payment. He is the creator of Zephie by means of genetic alterations of a fetus carried by <a href=Sarah.html>Sarah Green Anderson</a>.</p>

        <h2>Past</h2><hr>
        <p>
          He grew up in (insert place name), a planet in a another dimension, ruled by a tyranical superhuman named <a href="Kyron.html">Kyron</a>. When he was very young, Kyron altered his genetic code, giving him hyper inteligence. He soon realized that the world he lived in caused much pain and suffering and ran away to find a group of rebels when he was 10. The rebels were skeptical but eventually allowed him to help them due to his usefulness. He lived with them until he was ~17. After that he was kidnapped back by Kyron and was given cybernetic implant to transform him into a soldier to attack the rebels who raised him. Kyron did this for entertainment and the rebels realized that all of their progress was fabricated by Kyron. Ace resisted the urge to kill the rebels, telling them to leave, and instead self-combusted leaving a large building destroyed. The rebels believed that he was killed, but he was temporally and spacially displaced on Earth in May 13th 1873.

        <h2>Appearance</h2><hr>
        <p>
          He has many dark features, and almost always wears a contrasting white lab coat as per an Earth scientist would wear. The coat may have italian, english, or american vents. </p>

        <h2>Work in progress</h2><hr>
        <p>
          Ace has been around a long time, so it's likely that he created other genetic creations, but I can't do that if I want the character arc of him learning to love like a human again. I also like the idea that he has this extended family of creations that assist him on journeys and aren't the disposable criminals he usually employs. It would also add new character dynamics with Zephie having siblings, and her being the favorite of Ace. One of these siblings would have TaiYin and Ace as genetic donors with white hair. All siblings would have purple eyes and would pass it on to children if they were to have them. Some are immortal, some mortal.
