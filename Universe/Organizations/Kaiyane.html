          They wear something over their face like an arabic hijab? when encountering someone other than their yai’n. Just like how arabic women wear it in front of any other male besides their family, all subordinates, children, and low ranked people wear it in front of unfamiliar people. Their fabrics are most often weaved by mini spiders that are biologically programmed for certain weave designs and clothing types. Japanese/arabic style. On the overlapping layer that sits on the heart, there are red straps to tie to the layer beneath. This symbolizes that the uniform, and by proxy the duty of the clan, are tied to the heart through blood.</p>

          They are used to dark, chilly environments, so they get sunburned easily, and bright lights can disorient them. They are capable of a deep purring-like noise that is used when the person feels trapped, or with one’s Aiya. Aiya greet each other by touching noses and sometimes hugging or cuddling, similar to cats. They have a tapetum lucidum, which reflects light, allowing them to see in the dark better They often get easily motion sick when in a moving vehicle or from being spun or flipped too much. Although they can handle jumping, falling, and spinning in midair, when the motion is outside of their control, they can get upset and stressed. They are very sensitive to sounds, and get very stressed when exposed to loud sounds, or constant sound for too long They get extremely nervous when meeting new strangers. Talking to a new person is very uncommon unless necessary. They will always avoid it if possible. They also watch newcomers very closely They rarely hold eye contact with a superior, it is seen as a challenge to their authority. Between parents with their children, along with mentors and their students, eye contact is held for briefer moments, and is never held for a prolonged amount of time. They have a neurotoxin or myotoxin venomTheir pupils are star-shaped, but you can’t tell unless they are scared, their pupils contract, and it reveals the star shape Stellification is the visual effect where a kaiya's skin turns a deep blue with various starlike speckles and patterns</p>

          The Aiya comes first. You should never do anything that would bring harm to a Aiya Stay alive Do not cause a child unnecessary pain. (Less than 20 years old, only applies if the person is known or assumed to be a child) Anything could be a weapon Anything can be a weapon in someone else's hands Lies are weapons. The more you use them, the less trustworthy you will likely appear. The more experience someone has with anything, the more dangerous they are. Hiding doesn’t always mean concealing yourself. It just means being where you think no one will check. It doesn't matter how high you can jump, it's how safely you can land.</p>
