---Ace backstory
	Ace was created by Kyron in his attempt to create beings that he could use to become more powerful. He had made many other entities. Jupiter was deemed defective and cast aside. He then went to Aoria. He was harrassed by some of the gods who saw him as weak and incapable. After an amount of harrasement he responded by killing and stealing someone's powers. The other gods left him alone, but Jupiter wanted them to obey him. He became king of the gods. Before he became king, "Prometheus" knew from the start that Jupiter was dangerous, so she and her brother "epimetheus" assisted Jupiter in the conflict. For this, Jupiter rewarded them with control over making the creatures of Aoria.
	Epimetheus created the animals based on the forms created by other gods. He gave them all sorts of abilities. Prometheus took longer, and was made fun of by Jupiter. Jupiter eventually gave up on Aoria thinking the animals on it were boring. Then one day he came back to Aoria out of curiosity and discovered humans, made by Prometheus. He took a human to the land of the gods and confronted Prometheus for creating an animal that looked like the gods, angry that she disgraced the form of the gods. He took Prometheus and went back to Aoria to force her to destroy what she created and start again. When they arrived the humans had started to worship Jupiter due to his imense power last time he appeared. This confused Jupiter and he asked Prometheus why they were doing that. She said they were worshiping him because they respected his power. He decided not to kill them because he said it would be too much effort, but in reality he was confused and didn't want to simply destroy something he didn't understand.
	Prometheus had grown very fond of her creation, spending time with them and seeing their struggle and weakness in comparison to her own power. She couldn't give what she had, only Jupiter had to ability to steal and grant power. She stole some fire from the forge and gave it to humantiy. Jupiter was furious that humanity was trying to imitate the superiority of the gods, and mad that Prometheus had the abiliy to fool him. Jupiter decided to capture and punish Prometheus for being so difficult. He tried torturing her to get prophecies out. Some were successful but others were kept secret. Jupiter on multiple occasions almost absorbed her to gain her powers, but resisted because of the help she gave him in the past.
	
	Ace was once a God. He was born of Kyron, an entity that rules throught cruelty and fea. Ace grew up spoiled, hardly even feeling discomfort. But he slowly started to see throguh the cracks of the system, discovering suffering. When his father learned of his rebellion, he severely crippled the young Ace. This caused him to attain vampiric qualities, as in the ability to absorb and assume another's characteristics.
	
	---
	Should Jupiter create disease before Prometheus steals fire? Normally creating disease happens as punishment for humanity having fire, but I could see Jupiter wanting to see how they respond to difficulty because he's curious. It doesn't seem like him to just punish humanity for being given something, but he was more vindictive back then.

Typhe was raised by wolves

Typhe has lightning powers from Ace, who's domain is lightning

Zephie losing her memory is a running theme

Zephie always runs away from the people who love her and the climax is her accepting them and wanting their company
Zephie is designed to defeat tyrants. 

Ace's character arc is all about discovering humanity. He was born a deity that doesn't understand it very well.

I'd like to steer away from the greek centric mythology symbols.

Jayte's father goes to prison along with his family
Jayte goes to be executed, Jayte goes to prison, Jayte's mother goes to a mental asylum, and the two sisters go to an orphanage.
Neo
Jayte kills himself using necromancy and revives himself to escape prison

In Rystallia only women are allowed to be police officers, because they are less likely to be violent and they believe that women should protect the home from inside.

In the skyrapptor isles, wives speak on behalf of their husbands more than the husbands speak for themselves. In negotiation, the wife is the mediator and main talker. This is important to men to find a wife in regards to how she can mediate and discuss things for him. He has control over her and uses her as a mouthpiece so he has no effort to give to form a conversation. Conversation is a feminine sill in this culture.





	I flipped the book closed in frusteration. I had never truly considered how one sided this part of our history really was. The thought of putting an opinion in a textbook was appalling to me. I wanted to learn. I wanted to hear the full story. What was wrong with necromancy? Everyone I know would condemn it in a heartbeat, but the reason why gets uncomfortably murky. I glanced at my fingertips, nausatingly curious about what power they hold, but unable to unleash it out of fear.
