<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>Adora was raised from infancy by the sorceress <a href="/wiki/Shadow_Weaver" title="Shadow Weaver">Shadow Weaver</a>, as a member of the <a href="/wiki/The_Horde" title="The Horde">Horde</a>. On the day Adora is finally given recognition and rewarded with becoming a <a href="/wiki/Force_Captains" class="mw-redirect" title="Force Captains">Force Captain</a> she ends up captured by members of the Rebellion. However, after spending time with and befriending <a href="/wiki/Bow" title="Bow">Bow</a> and <a href="/wiki/Glimmer" title="Glimmer">Glimmer</a>, Adora realizes that everything she had ever been told or believed was wrong.
</p><p>With the <a href="/wiki/Sword_of_Protection" title="Sword of Protection">Sword of Protection</a> in hand, Adora gains the ability to transform into the Princess of Power —<b><a href="/wiki/She-Ra_(line)" title="She-Ra (line)">She-Ra</a></b>. She also discovered she was not born on <a href="/wiki/Etheria" title="Etheria">Etheria</a>, she actually belongs to a race called the <a href="/wiki/First_Ones" title="First Ones">First Ones</a> and brought to Etheria through a portal by <a href="/wiki/Light_Hope" title="Light Hope">Light Hope</a>. After shattering her original sword she eventually learned to draw the power from within her and transform into <a href="/wiki/She-Ra_(line)" title="She-Ra (line)">She-Ra</a> without it, as well as being able to summon a new magic sword into existence when needed.
</p><p>After battling the Horde and finally defeating <a href="/wiki/Horde_Prime" title="Horde Prime">Horde Prime</a> once and for all, she and her childhood friend and former enemy turned girlfriend, <a href="/wiki/Catra" title="Catra">Catra</a>, decide to explore and restore magic to the universe with their friends <a href="/wiki/Bow" title="Bow">Bow</a> and <a href="/wiki/Glimmer" title="Glimmer">Glimmer</a>.
</p><p>Adora is said by the creators to be 17-18 years old at the beginning of the series and 20-21 years old by the end of it as, according to Noelle, 3 years has passed since Season One.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Appearance">Appearance</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Adora">Adora</span></h3>
<p>She has long, dark blonde hair tied into a high ponytail, bluebell eyes, and narrow brown eyebrows, she has an athletic build, wears a long-sleeved white turtleneck with pointed sleeves, and red accents (one of which being the Horde symbol on her back, removed after she defects to the Rebellion). Usually worn over her shirt is a red jacket with quarter length sleeves, and a popped beige collar (until she defects, she wears the <a href="/wiki/Force_Captain_Badge" class="mw-redirect" title="Force Captain Badge">Force Captain Badge</a>). She also wears grey leggings and a brown belt with a Horde buckle, which is later replaced with a golden wing, a symbol of her newfound Rebellion allegiance.
</p><p>In her vision of the future, Adora now wears a long white dress and cape with gold trim and gold headband. She appears to be taller and her hair has been let down and grown longer.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="She-Ra">She-Ra</span></h3>
<p>She-Ra has long, wavy/straight light blonde hair —which can also glow— and light blue eyes. She also has a thin golden crown with two wings on each side, and a red jewel in the center, and solid, golden arm cuffs. She wears a white dress with a golden, six-pointed flower embroidered on the chest, divided by a golden seam that splits the bodice from collar to belt. At the center of the flower sits an oval azure gemstone. Her sleeves are golden, pointed pauldrons that stand of their own accord. The aforementioned seam blends into the gold trim of her uniform collar and ends when it reaches the apex of her thick golden belt, creating a V-shaped belt at her waist. Her white ruffled skirt, which begins under the belt, is open at the front revealing a pair of white, skin-tight shorts striped with a thick golden line on the outside of each thigh. <a href="/wiki/She-Ra_(line)" title="She-Ra (line)">She-Ra</a> also wears knee-high athletic white and aqua boots, with gold soles and accents. She completes her ensemble with a knee-length red cape. She is also about 8 feet tall, taller than many of the other characters.
</p><p>During the events of "<a href="/wiki/Save_the_Cat" title="Save the Cat">Save the Cat</a>", Adora finally obtains the new <a href="/wiki/She-Ra_(line)" title="She-Ra (line)">She-Ra</a> transformation. Her hair is a slightly lighter blonde and is in a style similar to her civilian one, but her ponytail is longer. She is now wearing long white pants and boots with gold wing decals (representing <a href="/wiki/Glimmer" title="Glimmer">Glimmer</a>), Her shirt more now looks more like a blouse with a long back and red inside, the shirt also sports a heart outlined in gold (representing <a href="/wiki/Bow" title="Bow">Bow</a>), her golden tiara is significantly changed to look more like Catra's former mask (representing <a href="/wiki/Catra" title="Catra">Catra</a>).
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Personality">Personality</span></h2>
<p>Adora is a brave, competitive, and noble warrior and is true to her own values. She's very strong as it's seen in an arm-wrestling match where she beats the well built and strong-arm wrestler, <a href="/wiki/Sea_Hawk" title="Sea Hawk">Sea Hawk</a>. She is shown to be a leader in every group she joins. Realizing what the Horde has done to innocent <a href="/wiki/Etheria" title="Etheria">Etherians</a>, she makes a major life decision (to leave the Horde). Reluctantly, she is willing to lose her lifelong friend, <a href="/wiki/Catra" title="Catra">Catra</a>, in order to remain true to her values.
</p><p>Despite making the decision to leave <a href="/wiki/The_Horde" title="The Horde">the Horde</a>, Adora has been shown to be most comfortable following rules and sticking to plans. She is not entirely socially competent, having been raised in a military environment, and therefore is typically very blunt and always prefers to be prepared for battle. She is also shown to be unaware of certain familial terms such as "Aunt".
</p><p>Adora's heroic deeds, power, and positivity begin to grow as she and her friends continue to battle the Evil Horde. She suffers from occasional clumsiness especially when trying to control her powers, weaponry, or when trying to bond with <a href="/wiki/Swift_Wind" title="Swift Wind">Swift Wind</a>. Adora struggles with pressure when discussing the allies' strike plan in the war tent. Despite all this, Adora/She-Ra works to overcome her fear and become a powerful warrior to save <a href="/wiki/Etheria" title="Etheria">Etheria</a> from tyranny.
</p><p>Due to Shadow Weaver’s abuse, Adora believes that she alone is responsible for the well-being of others. In fact, since becoming She-Ra, she has gained a notable martyr complex. She constantly puts her relationships aside even if they are healthy when it comes to battling the Horde. Notably, after destroying the Sword of Protection, Adora constantly threw herself into battle without regard for her own well-being. Even more notably, she is perfectly willing to sacrifice her own life when it seems necessary. Notable instances were in “<a href="/wiki/The_Portal_(episode)" title="The Portal (episode)">The Portal</a>” and “<a href="/wiki/Heart_Part_2" title="Heart Part 2">Heart Part 2</a>.” In the former, after being saved by <a href="/wiki/Queen_Angella" class="mw-redirect" title="Queen Angella">Queen Angella</a>, attempts to remove the sword from the portal, but Angella, feeling more remorse over her cowardly actions, sacrifices herself instead. In the latter, when she is prevented from transforming into She-Ra, which would allow her to survive using the Failsafe, Adora opts to use it anyway, even rebuking Catra’s support at first, but she has been infected long enough that she cannot use the Failsafe at all.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Powers">Powers</span></h3>
<ul><li><b>Powers via the <a href="/wiki/Sword_of_Protection" title="Sword of Protection">Sword of Protection</a> (And later by herself)</b>:
<ul><li><b>Transformation </b>: Using the Sword of Protection, Adora can transform into the legendary warrior She-Ra. Described by Mermista as being eight-feet tall, Adora becomes much taller and more muscular when transformed into She-Ra. Her hair also becomes longer and a much lighter shade of blonde. Her eyes become lighter-blue and when affected by the runestone, turns white. Finally, Adora's clothes are transformed into She-Ra's costume. With the sword broken she discovered the power within and can now transform without it and can materialize a <a href="/wiki/Sword_of_Protection" title="Sword of Protection">new sword</a> as well.</li>
<li>Adora can also transform the sword into any form (Season Two and onward). Some include, a shield, a flute, a mop, a whip, and a cup.
<ul><li><b><a href="/wiki/Superhuman_strength" title="Superhuman strength">Superhuman Strength</a></b>: Adora is incredibly strong as She-Ra, being able to easily lift alder and punch dents into Horde tanks with very little effort. Even without She-Ra powers Adora is very strong which can be seen when she wins an arm-wrestling match against well built, strong <a href="/wiki/Sea_Hawk" title="Sea Hawk">Sea Hawk</a> who himself is an excellent wrestler.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Superhuman_agility" title="Superhuman agility">Superhuman Agility</a></b>: Adora is shown to be able to make incredible leaps while transformed.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Healing_Powers" title="Healing Powers">Healing Powers</a></b>: According to Perfuma, She-Ra is said to possess powerful healing abilities. The first time Adora successfully performed this ability as She-Ra was when she restored Plumeria using the very same machine the Horde used to poison the land as the conduit, reversing the damage. Later, Shadow Weaver guides Adora into being able to heal her using the runestone housed in She-Ra's sword.</li></ul></li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Animal_Transformation" title="Animal Transformation">Animal Transformation</a></b>: Energy from the sword's Runestone is shown to mutate animals. This is shown twice on the show. The first being a reptile in Plumeria that scurries away. The second resulted in the transformation of “Horsey” into “Swift Wind”. Swift Wind's transformation was physical and mental, giving the creature intelligence, an alicorn and wings. It also created a bond between Adora and Swift Wind that strengthens with teamwork.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Ergokinesis" title="Ergokinesis">Energy Blast</a>: </b>Focused<b> </b>through the sword and is rainbow-colored.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Aura_generation" class="mw-redirect" title="Aura generation">Aura Generation</a></b>: When united with the other Princesses, Adora can generate an aura that greatly increases her power. Her aura manifests in white with some little pale yellow glowing.</li>
<li><b>Animal Magic</b>: She-Ra has the power to calm aggression in animals. We see this in The Sword: pt 1 after she transforms when being attack by a giant bug-like creature.</li>
<li><b>Sword Summoning:</b> In <a href="/wiki/Season_Five" title="Season Five">Season Five</a>, with her new She-Ra form comes the ability to summon a <a href="/wiki/Sword_of_Protection" title="Sword of Protection">new sword</a> that seems to be just as powerful as her old one.</li>
<li><b>Space Survival:</b> In her She-Ra form she can travel trough the void of space without the assistance of a space suit.</li></ul></li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Abilities">Abilities</span></h3>
<ul><li><b>Expert Hand-to-Hand Combatant</b>: Even before finding the Sword, Adora was an incredibly skilled combatant as a result of her cadet training with the Horde. She was able to complete her training in record time. She hasn't shown much skill after her initial appearance but seems to have reclaimed this skill in <a href="/wiki/Season_Five" title="Season Five">Season Five</a>.</li>
<li><b>Navigation and Survival</b>: Using materials in the <a href="/wiki/Crimson_Waste" title="Crimson Waste">Crimson Waste</a>, Adora was able to find the right way to go.</li>
<li><b>Leadership</b>: Adora has been shown to be a competent leader, capable of coordinating her allies and develop strategies.</li>
<li><b>Indomitable Will</b></li></ul>

<ul><li><b>First One's Artifact/Corrupted Virus (briefly) </b>: If the sword is directly infected with the <a href="/wiki/Data_Disk" title="Data Disk">Data Disk</a> when she is She-Ra, she enters a violent berserker rage and becomes incapable of differentiating friend (Bow, Glimmer and Sea Hawk) or foe (Catra). Taking The Sword of Protection from Adora and destroying the Data Disc is the only way to stop its corruption. Once the Sword of Protection is taken from Adora falls into an inebriated state. She doesn't remember what happened.</li>
<li><b>Unclear Mind:</b> If her mind is unfocused or full of doubt she cannot transform into She-Ra.</li>
<li><b>Extreme hair envy with She-ra:</b> As Netossa explained in Season Five, Adora has a couple insecurities, one of them being her hair.</li></ul>

<p>Adora and <a href="/wiki/Catra" title="Catra">Catra</a> have been described as the "core relationship and the core conflict of the show." They grew up in the Horde together as orphans and became best friends. Catra had a close and intense relationship with Adora, tinged with a rivalry that was exacerbated when <a href="/wiki/Shadow_Weaver" title="Shadow Weaver">Shadow Weaver</a> favored Adora over her. Adora for her part has always tried to be a good and loving friend to Catra, often going out of her way to find and comfort Catra when she was upset about something. Even if this sometimes resulted in Catra just being mean to her, Adora never seemed to care as long as in the end Catra was OK. As Noelle Stevenson put it, "As much as these two people really, really care about each other, there are also things that ... some of them are not their own choice".

<p>In the first two seasons, Adora tried over and over again to convince Catra to leave the Horde and join her, but Catra was consumed by feelings of betrayal and anger towards Adora. In their subsequent encounters, she was bitter and cruel towards Adora, perceiving her defection to the Rebellion as a personal rejection. Adora, blind to Catra's pain, often referred to Catra's actions as just another game. When the two ended up alone together in Episode 11 Adora has a hard time treating Catra as an enemy and quickly tries to reestablish their old friendship.
</p><p>Obsessed with proving her worth to the Horde and beating her former friend, Catra's various plans to defeat Adora become bolder, riskier, and more violent, and at times put the very existence of Etheria at risk. Adora blamed herself for Catra's actions, often feeling that she had somehow just failed to properly convince her. Its not until Catra almost destroys Etheria at the end of <a href="/wiki/Season_Three" title="Season Three">Season Three</a>, that Adora formally severs her friendship with Catra. This is best showcased in the relatively minimal interactions between the two during <a href="/wiki/Season_Four" title="Season Four">Season Four</a>.
</p><p>Season Five would see the two's relationship return in a big way after Catra aids Glimmer's escape from Horde Prime's ship. Believing she was preforming her last act, Catra apologizes to Adora via a transmission, for everything that she had done. Adora becomes distraught and upset when the message goes quiet. After rescuing Glimmer Adora confirms that Catra had indeed saved the young Queen, and learns that Catra had done it to stop Adora from falling into Horde Prime's trap.
</p><p>After spending time thinking about their past Adora decides she can't leave Catra with Horde Prime even after everything she's done. With her friend's blessing, Adora, Bow, Glimmer and Entrapta go to rescue Catra. Adora pretends to surrender to Horde Prime in the hopes that the others will find and rescue Catra while she plays decoy.

<p>When Horde Prime reveals that he had turned Catra into his puppet with a <a href="/wiki/Horde_Chip" title="Horde Chip">Horde Chip</a>, Adora was left completely aghast. As they fight, and thanks to damaging the chip, Catra is able to come back to her senses and tells Adora she should have stayed away because Catra's life doesn't matter. Adora assures Catra it does matter to her. Horde Prime then tries to kill Catra via the chip and sends her tumbling off a balcony. Adora follows, and finds Catra near death on the ground with Horde Prime gloating via his Clones. Angry Adora is able to transform onto She-Ra for the first time with out the sword and escapes from Horde Primes ship with Catra. Once away Adora uses her last bit of power to heal Catra and they embrace each other.
</p><p>Once healed though it doesn't take Catra long to back slide into her old self much to Adora's annoyance, but once Adora reveals during an argument that she never hated Catra even after everything she has done, we see a much softer side to the Cat Girl. For the rest of the trip home, Catra tries to work on being a better friend, much to Adora's happiness. This also begins to show itself with the two being much more flirtatious with each other. Adora and Catra become much more prone to blushing around each other as they also fall back into their friendly but competitive friendship. They also both begin to show an extreme protectiveness of each other, often throwing themselves into danger to save the other.
</p><p>
Back on Etheria, their relationship hits a few bumps again, thanks in no small part to Shadow Weaver's machinations. Adora's willingness to follow Shadow Weaver's plan despite the high risk of her own death, leaves Catra angry and hurt. But eventually, Catra is able to see that Adora's desire to protect the world doesn't diminish her love for Catra. </p><figure class="thumb tleft show-info-icon" style="width: 252px"> 	<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/shera-and-the-princesses-of-power/images/e/e4/A_%26_C_love_2.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20200527153857" class="image"><img alt="" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" width="250" height="142" class="thumbimage lazyload" data-image-name="A &amp; C love 2.PNG" data-image-key="A_&amp;_C_love_2.PNG" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/shera-and-the-princesses-of-power/images/e/e4/A_%26_C_love_2.PNG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20200527153857" /></a> 	<noscript><a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/shera-and-the-princesses-of-power/images/e/e4/A_%26_C_love_2.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20200527153857" class="image"><img alt="" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/shera-and-the-princesses-of-power/images/e/e4/A_%26_C_love_2.PNG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20200527153857" decoding="async" width="250" height="142" class="thumbimage" data-image-name="A &amp; C love 2.PNG" data-image-key="A_&amp;_C_love_2.PNG" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/shera-and-the-princesses-of-power/images/e/e4/A_%26_C_love_2.PNG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20200527153857" /></a></noscript> 	<figcaption class="thumbcaption"> 		 			<a href="/wiki/File:A_%26_C_love_2.PNG" class="info-icon"><svg><use xlink:href="#wds-icons-info-small"></use></svg></a> 		 		 		 			<p class="caption">The power of love has conquered the forces of hate</p> 		 	</figcaption> </figure>

Promptly named 'Best Friends Squad' by <a href="/wiki/Bow" title="Bow">Bow</a>, their friendship and common goals make them the leads of the series. They officially meet during "<a href="/wiki/The_Sword:_Part_1" title="The Sword: Part 1">The Sword: Part 1</a>", Adora, who is still aligned with the Horde, meets Bow and Glimmer in the Whispering Woods while they are both looking for the <a href="/wiki/Sword_of_Protection" title="Sword of Protection">Sword of Protection</a>. With Horde propaganda about the Princess Rebellion as an education, Adora is hostile, aggressive and insulting towards the pair, attempting to reclaim the sword. However, after the invasion of Thaymore, they become best friends and rebellion leaders together.
</p><p class="mw-empty-elt"></p><p>After learning of the Horde's true agenda, Adora defects from the organization, instead choosing to co-lead the Rebellion with Princess Glimmer, sharing the title of leader much like her parents had. Adora is shown to have anxiety about her new title, only voicing her concerns to Bow and Glimmer, who try their best to put her at ease. However, sometimes they too play into the idea of an overpowered, all-knowing She-Ra, such as in "<a href="/wiki/Flowers_for_She-Ra" title="Flowers for She-Ra">Flowers for She-Ra</a>", they are shown telling clearly fictional stories of She-Ra to an amazed crowd of Plumerians.
</p><p>However, despite this, they are quick to defend her and not allow her to internalize her failures, such as Bow comforting a distraught Adora (who is in her She-Ra form) and informing her that it is okay that she failed, as long as she wasn't hurt. Likewise, in "<a href="/wiki/In_the_Shadows_of_Mystacor" title="In the Shadows of Mystacor">In the Shadows of Mystacor</a>", Glimmer is very caring of Adora, not holding the mistakes she makes over her head and instead she comforts her frequently.
</p><p>Similarly, Adora is very protective over both Glimmer and Bow, putting them above herself more than once. In "<a href="/wiki/Reunion" title="Reunion">Reunion</a>", although she is initially not concerned with Bow's whereabouts like Glimmer is, she is horrified to see him in a full-length shirt and assumes that he is being tortured. In the same vein, after Glimmer's connection to the Moonstone was damaged by Shadow Weaver's magic and cannot stop glitching, Adora blames herself and goes out of her way to help Glimmer, who protests that it doesn't hurt. Likewise, when rescuing Bow and Glimmer, Lonnie recalls that "We, Horde squadron were once her friends, too." implying that Adora places her new Rebellion friends above her former ones.

<p>As of <a href="/wiki/Season_Five" title="Season Five">Season Five</a> Catra is now a member, who was welcomed with open arms, despite past grudges, as all has been forgiven.
</p><p>Their friendship isn't all serious, however, as they are shown to joke and tease each other. Specifically shown in "System Failure", as both Glimmer and Adora tease Bow over his ludicrous inventions, as well as not accepting the name 'Best Friends Squad' when he initially proposed it. Likewise, there are numerous scenes where Glimmer and Bow attempt to teach Adora proper social etiquette, only for her to relate it to her time in the Horde or military training and shenanigans ensue, such as in "<a href="/wiki/Princess_Prom" title="Princess Prom">Princess Prom</a>", "<a href="/wiki/Roll_With_It" title="Roll With It">Roll With It</a>", and "<a href="/wiki/Reunion" title="Reunion">Reunion</a>".

<p>Starting in "<a href="/wiki/The_Sword:_Part_1" title="The Sword: Part 1">The Sword: Part 1</a>", Glimmer and Adora initially have an antagonistic relationship, both girls not understanding why either would fight for the side they are on. As well, Adora is initially distrustful of Glimmer, ridiculing her need to charge her powers as well as referring to her as a 'princess' with disdain. Likewise, Glimmer did not trust Adora due to her seemingly willingness to align with the Horde despite their colonization of the planet. Their relationship, however, is completely changed after the Horde attacks Thaymor, and Glimmer begins to trust Adora as she learns that Adora was initially unaware of the Horde's true intentions or princess propaganda.
</p><p>Following this change, they are shown to be much closer throughout the following seasons, as Glimmer is shown to make more of an effort to understand Adora's past trauma. Such as "<a href="/wiki/In_the_Shadows_of_Mystacor" title="In the Shadows of Mystacor">In the Shadows of Mystacor</a>", where Glimmer goes out of her way to help Adora relax, despite her increasing paranoia. As well, Glimmer is patient with Adora, never scolding her for miss stepping when it comes to social boundaries that Adora breaks. Specifically in "<a href="/wiki/System_Failure" title="System Failure">System Failure</a>" and "In the Shadows of Mystacor", when Adora acts inebriated and foolish, Glimmer carries her to safety, and doesn't scold Adora when she breaks Mystacor's ancient crystals.

<p><a href="/wiki/Glimmer" title="Glimmer">Glimmer</a> and Adora are both shown to be protective over each other, exemplified by Adora in "<a href="/wiki/Huntara_(episode)" title="Huntara (episode)">Huntara</a>" and "<a href="/wiki/The_Beacon" title="The Beacon">The Beacon</a>", as she dives into quicksand without thought after <a href="/wiki/Glimmer" title="Glimmer">Glimmer</a> slips through, despite the princess being able to teleport out with ease, and when she is shown to worry about Glimmer and considers giving up her new friends and attachments under the condition that she can heal Glimmer immediately. respectively. Glimmer sheds tears for Adora in "<a href="/wiki/Princess_Prom" title="Princess Prom">Princess Prom</a>" and is able to overcome her bondage to stop Shadow Weaver from erasing Adora's memory. They would collide again on Adora's behalf In "<a href="/wiki/The_Price_of_Power" title="The Price of Power">The Price of Power</a>", when Glimmer threatens Shadow Weaver with her magic if she harms Adora in any way. She then smirks proudly when Adora begins defending herself from Shadow Weaver's manipulation. Glimmer's patience with Adora can border on protectiveness as in "<a href="/wiki/System_Failure" title="System Failure">System Failure</a>", where she carries Adora around and threatens Entrapta on her behalf, and in "<a href="/wiki/White_Out" title="White Out">White Out</a>", where she stops fighting in order to embrace an infected Adora. In "<a href="/wiki/The_Portal" class="mw-redirect" title="The Portal">The Portal</a>", Adora acknowledges Glimmer's strengths, and even goes as far as to say she had never met anyone like her.
</p><p>Glimmer's words and presence are shown to be comforting to Adora. Demonstrated best with "<a href="/wiki/In_the_Shadows_of_Mystacor" title="In the Shadows of Mystacor">In the Shadows of Mystacor</a>". After finally defeating Shadow Weaver, Adora is still on edge and wakes up abruptly, and is only soothed as she reaches out for Glimmer, and calms in her touch. As well, in "<a href="/wiki/Roll_With_It" title="Roll With It">Roll With It</a>", Adora is anxious about taking on Catra, and only Glimmer's speech about "<a href="/wiki/Roll_With_It/Transcript" title="Roll With It/Transcript">rolling with the punches</a>" can ease her mind. It is flipped following the events of <a href="/wiki/Season_Three" title="Season Three">Season Three</a> with the entrapment of Angella, as Adora is there to comfort Glimmer, pulling her into a protective hug and pushing their foreheads together as a sign of condolences.
</p><p>They also seem to have a very enthusiastic relationship, as "<a href="/wiki/In_the_Shadows_of_Mystacor" title="In the Shadows of Mystacor">In the Shadows of Mystacor</a>", "<a href="/wiki/Princess_Prom" title="Princess Prom">Princess Prom</a>" and "<a href="/wiki/The_Sword:_Part_2" title="The Sword: Part 2">The Sword: Part 2</a>", Glimmer is shown to gush about things she enjoys as she explains them in detail while Adora listens and learns social etiquette. Glimmer and Adora are similar when it comes to some activities, such as their love of fighting, weapons and violence. Specifically in "<a href="/wiki/System_Failure" title="System Failure">System Failure</a>", when Glimmer remarks about a boulder that needs smashing and Adora is quick to oblige. And, as Catra puts it, they're both 'gullible and easy to manipulate', remarking that they're 'perfect' for each other. Although she was teasing them, they do have much in common. They are both reckless and headstrong, putting what they believe in above all else. They also tease Bow together, such as in System Failure, when they ridicule his trick arrows and initially do not accept the name 'Best Friends Squad.'
</p><p>Likewise, Angella compares her past relationship with Micah to Glimmer and Adora's current one, stating that she made a mistake in letting her father go and that Glimmer should not do the same to Adora.

<p>In <a href="/wiki/Season_Four" title="Season Four">Season Four</a>, their relationship goes through major tension because of their debate on how to defeat the Horde. It first started with Glimmer using Adora as bait in "<a href="/wiki/Pulse" title="Pulse">Pulse</a>", Adora was also both shocked and angry when she leaned that Glimmer was letting Shadow Weaver teach her magic. Their relationship became even more strained thanks to <a href="/wiki/Double_Trouble" title="Double Trouble">Double Trouble</a>'s meddling when they were posing as <a href="/wiki/Flutterina" title="Flutterina">Flutterina</a>.

<p>Meeting each other for the first time in "<a href="/wiki/The_Sword:_Part_1" title="The Sword: Part 1">The Sword: Part 1</a>", Bow is initially distrusting of Adora. However, he is still shown to be chivalrous and kind towards her and attempts to get to know her. His kindness to Adora doesn't stop at that, however, as he comically over reacts to learning that she doesn't know what 'parties' or 'aunts' are. He is quick to show and indulge her.
</p><p>Of the pair, Bow can often be seen being 'the brain' of the pair, as he corrects Adora's missteps.

Their relationship is further strained when Adora accidentally sits in King Micah's chair during a meeting, which angers Angella greatly.

<p>Shadow Weaver took her as an orphaned child into the Horde. According to Adora, Shadow Weaver taught her how to read and how to tie her boots. She saw great promise in her and raised her to become a great soldier to fight against The Rebellion. When Adora defected, Shadow Weaver did everything within her power to try and get her back, even going against Lord Hordak's orders. She also turn to Adora to heal her when she escaped the Horde and on the verge of death. Adora still did not trust; as she was visibly upset that Shadow Weaver was teaching Glimmer magic and even suspected her of being a spy. Despite their history she was willing to listen to her when she leaned of the <a href="/wiki/Crystal_of_Arxia" title="Crystal of Arxia">fail safe</a> to stop the <a href="/wiki/Heart_of_Etheria" title="Heart of Etheria">super weapon</a> at the planet's core, but still showed her disdain for her "Mother Figure". In the final battle she wept when Shadow Weaver died saving her and Catra from a <a href="/wiki/First_One_Security_Monster" title="First One Security Monster">security monster</a> showing she truly cared for the sorceresses.

<p>Adora meets Swift Wind as Horsey, a regular brown horse in the town of <a href="/wiki/Thaymor" title="Thaymor">Thaymor</a>. She instantly took a liking toward him and took him back to <a href="/wiki/Bright_Moon" title="Bright Moon">Bright Moon</a>. Adora was trying to impress Horsey (Swift Wind) by turning into She-Ra when a flash from the sword turned him into an alicorn with a rainbow mane and a horn. At first, he doesn't take too kindly to being transformed but later accepts it, even renaming himself from Horsey to the now known Swift Wind. He and Adora have a close connection to one another. He can sense when she is in distress.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Madame_Razz"><a href="/wiki/Madame_Razz" title="Madame Razz">Madame Razz</a></span></h3>
<p>Adora met Razz shortly after she defected from the Horde. She seeks out Razz when the magic of Etheria is too much for her to understand. She relies heavily upon the crone's wisdom.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Light_Hope"><a href="/wiki/Light_Hope" title="Light Hope">Light Hope</a></span></h3>
<p>Initially Adora was skeptical of Light Hope but later came to trust the A.I. Light Hope trained and guided Adora to become She-Ra and instructed her to "balance the planet". Light Hope sent Adora and Swift Wind on a quest to fix the <a href="/wiki/Watchtower" title="Watchtower">Watchtower</a>, during this quest the pair formed a magical bond, which Light Hope also instructed them to do.
</p><p>As Adora grew stronger and gained skill, <a href="/wiki/Light_Hope" title="Light Hope">Light Hope</a> revealed her plan to re-activate the <a href="/wiki/Heart_of_Etheria" title="Heart of Etheria">Heart of Etheria</a>. This became a point of contention between the two. Light Hope insisting that Adora follow her destiny to balance the planet so the Heart of Etheria could be activated; Adora resisted, believing that her duty was to her friends and to protect Etheria. Adora continued to resist Light Hope's insistence that she must follow her fate; Adora chose to make her own way. Adora broke the blade of the Sword of Protection despite Light Hope's objections. This de-activated Light Hope, but not before the A.I. thanked the princess for being her friend and for saving planet from <a href="/wiki/The_Heart_of_Etheria_Project" title="The Heart of Etheria Project">the Heart of Etheria Project</a>.

<p>They all had a tight bond with one another - despite Catra being her best friend - while in the Horde. Lonnie didn't take it very well when Adora defected and then came back to fight against them in a rescue mission to save Glimmer. Lonnie later states in <a href="/wiki/Season_Four" title="Season Four">Season Four</a> that the loyalty they had been raised on in the Horde was a lie, citing Adora's leaving as a reason, showing how hard she took her leaving.

Sea Hawk and Adora are both very competitive by nature. The two of them often arm wrestle, and Adora always wins so it's clear she's stronger.

<p>Adora is fascinated by first seeing Huntara and asks her to be the squad's guide in the Crimson Waste. Huntara first betrayed The Squad, but then joined them and let them to Mara's ship.

Light Hope brought Adora into Etheria by a portal from another place which the <a href="/wiki/First_Ones" title="First Ones">First Ones</a> had come from. The First Ones created the Sword of Protection to activate the <a href="/wiki/Heart_of_Etheria" title="Heart of Etheria">Heart of Etheria</a> which was built by the First Ones to turn Etheria into a giant weapon.

There, she encounters Catra and numerous illusions draw forth memories of their past together, always promising to watch out for each other, but their bond cannot be mended and Catra departs.

<p>Adora continues to train with Light Hope to enhance her martial prowess as She-Ra while staving off the Horde that continues to assail the woods. She along with Bow find themselves in a rut as they struggle to capture one of their robots, and when they do, they realize that Entrapta is alive as <a href="/wiki/First_Ones" title="First Ones">First Ones</a> technology has been embedded into the machines, something only she could do.
</p><p>While <a href="/wiki/Glimmer" title="Glimmer">Glimmer</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bow" title="Bow">Bow</a> handle that, Adora is sent to fix an outpost by Light Hope in order to bring her to full computational capacity. She then continues to <a href="/wiki/Alwyn" title="Alwyn">Alwyn</a>, where reports of hauntings turn out to be old First Ones communications that were never properly sent, which Adora resolves. Later, Adora struggles to formulate a plan to take a strategic Horde-occupied fortress, but none of her compatriots take her planning seriously. She eventually ends up assaulting the fortress with nothing but improvisation, and the operation is successful.
</p><p>In the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Reach" title="Northern Reach">Northern Reach</a>, Adora seeks out an anomalous Horde outpost to stop whatever they are attempting, and end up encountering Catra and Entrapta. Catra uses an old <a href="/wiki/Data_Disk" title="Data Disk">Data Disk</a> of Entrapta's that infects First One's technology to infect the <a href="/wiki/Sword_of_Protection" title="Sword of Protection">Sword of Protection</a>, Adora's <a href="/wiki/Sword_of_Protection" title="Sword of Protection">Sword is</a> part First One's tech, the infection caused Adora to fly into an indiscriminate rampage until separated from her sword. After Scorpia separated Adora from her sword she became docile and incoherent. <a href="/wiki/Scorpia" title="Scorpia">Scorpia</a> eventually destroys the disk in order to save Catra from similarly infected First Ones' <a href="/wiki/Snow_Monsters" title="Snow Monsters">Snow Monsters</a>, freeing Adora from her stupor as her adversaries flee the area.
</p><p>It is later revealed, incorrectly, that Adora was brought into the Horde by Hordak when he opened a portal very briefly - it was Light Hope that opened the portal that brought Adora to Etheria. Adora meanwhile helps Bow with a transmission he found, thinking it a message about her past or past She-Ra's. Bow leaves to investigate, but Glimmer and Adora follow, discovering Bow's secret; he has two fathers who believe him to be a historian-in-training at a made up academy. Adora advises him to tell his fathers the truth while they quiz her on her knowledge of First Ones' language,until she accidentally activates another First Ones' <a href="/wiki/Elemental" title="Elemental">elemental</a>. She transforms into She-Ra and holds it off until Bow can deactivate it. Later, with his fathers, they discover that the message Bow found can only be properly heard at the center of the <a href="/wiki/Crimson_Waste" title="Crimson Waste">Crimson Waste</a>.

<p>When she presented her discovery to the Princess Alliance she and Bow declared their plan to disable the super weapon, but Glimmer wanted to use its power to defeat the Horde. During the debate, Scorpia appeared in front of everyone. While the princesses attacked Scopria and <a href="/wiki/Emily" title="Emily">Emily</a> they stopped when Scopria asked for their help to save Entrapta from <a href="/wiki/Beast_Island" title="Beast Island">Beast Island</a>. Glimmer forbade Adora and Bow to go on a rescue mission, so they along with Swift Wind sneak out and use Mara's ship to locate and fly to Beast Island.
</p><p>When they arrived at Beast Island they encounter Glimmer's father <a href="/wiki/King_Micah" class="mw-redirect" title="King Micah">King Micah</a> who is surprisingly still alive. But it during their search for Entrapta; Adora discovers she can't transform into She-Ra. She thinks it's the island interfering with her powers but then finds out it was her own doubts about her ability to stop the Horde and her damaged friendship with Glimmer that prevented from transforming. After she renews her vows to protect Glimmer and everyone she finally becomes She-Ra. After that Entrapta comes to rescue them from multiple monsters with a giant robot she built.
</p><p>During the season finale, Entrapta took Adora and her party to a First Ones' temple at the center of Beast Island were she discovered the <a href="/wiki/The_Heart_of_Etheria_Project" title="The Heart of Etheria Project">First Ones' plan</a> to use the Heart of Etheria against their enemies, and that She-Ra is the key to activating and firing the weapon. The group sees that <a href="/wiki/The_Black_Garnet" title="The Black Garnet">the Black Garnet</a> is still offline. It was then that they realized that they needed to hurry back to Bright Moon to stop <a href="/wiki/Glimmer" title="Glimmer">Glimmer</a> from reactivating the Heart. Entapta resisted at first but change her mind when Adora informed her of the First Ones ship they flew to get to the island. They make it back only to learn from Shadow Weaver that Glimmer had already gone to the Fright Zone with Scorpia.

<p>Adora left <a href="/wiki/King_Micah" class="mw-redirect" title="King Micah">Micah</a> at Bright Moon to recuperate, calls the Sorcerers guild of Mystacor to protect the castle and tells Bow, Entrapta and Swift Wind to go after Glimmer. When Light Hope successfully reactivated the Heart, Adora felt it and hurried to the <a href="/wiki/Crystal_Castle" class="mw-redirect" title="Crystal Castle">Crystal Castle</a> in an effort to stop the weapon. Light Hope takes control of Adora's sword and body; preparing to fire the weapon. Adora tried to reason with Light Hope saying that the First Ones' war is long over only for the AI program to repudiate her by saying she will return the First Ones to glory. Adora reminds Light Hope that Mara stranded the planet in Despondos, but Light Hope is one step ahead of her as she uses the Heart and the power of She-Ra's Sword to bring them out of the shadow dimension and back to the wider universe. As Light Hope is switching between her true self and her reprogrammed self she tries to tell Adora that this is their destiny, but Adora shouts "This is not <i>my</i> destiny!" and with all her might she turns the power of The Heart of Etheria back into the sword, shattering the Sword of Protection's blade. A remorseful Light Hope thanks her before fading away. Adora steps out of the Crystal Castle and sees the <a href="/wiki/Horde_Armada" title="Horde Armada">Horde Armada</a> roaming the sky. She reunites with Bow; as they hug Bow informs her that Glimmer was captured and Adora informs him that her sword is broken. Bow then asks Adora what are they going to do; Adora even without She-Ra, answers that they were going to save Glimmer and then the Universe.

<p>At the beginning of the season, Adora struggles with her past as she cannot summon She-Ra and trains in order to be a better commander together with <a href="/wiki/Bow" title="Bow">Bow</a> in <a href="/wiki/The_Rebellion" title="The Rebellion">The Rebellion</a>. Adora along with others evacuated villagers to safety, fought bots and created a hidden base. She then attacked three <a href="/wiki/Horde_Prime%27s_Clone_Army" class="mw-redirect" title="Horde Prime&#39;s Clone Army">clones</a> and had to be rescued by Scorpia, Bow and Swift Wind; Scorpia had to sting Adora unconscious because she refused to retreat. Later she helped capture a clone and tried to question him, but left him behind to help their base which was under attack. After fending off the attackers she led the refugees to the deepest and safest part of the Whispering Woods.
</p><p>Adora struggled with having a normal body that does not have super powers. Bow took charge and demanded that everyone leave Adora alone to sleep, which she did, reluctantly. While sleeping Adora had a dream/vision of She-Ra. Adora chased her vision of She-Ra and talked with her about her doubts, regrets and whether or not she had a destiny, the She-Ra vision did not respond. Upon awakening she learned about Prime's reinforcements, Mermista told her to leave to rescue Glimmer quickly. With the Horde bearing down Micah used magic to disguise himself as She-Ra and drew the bots away from Mara's ship while Bow, Adora and Entrapta left in Mara's ship, leaving Mermista in charge.
</p><p>On Mara's ship Adora continued to train with her staff. When there was a malfunction in the computers she attacked the problem using duct tape with predictable results. Entrapta did a space walk and fixed the ship, which totally freaked out Bow and Adora. Catra contacted Adora and told her that she was going to send Glimmer to a nearby location and demanded that Adora not go to Prime's ship, to leave her behind. She screamed an apology at Adora before she was overcome by clones. Entrapta piloted Darla to Glimmer's coordinates while Adora and Bow did a space walk rescue of the Queen who was shielded from space with some sort of force field.

Aboard Darla, Mara's ship, Adora is surprised that Catra saved Glimmer's life. Glimmer told her that Catra wanted to do one good thing in her life. She apologized to Adora for activating the Heart of Etheria and for being so cruel to Bow and Adora but Bow couldn't hear because he left to check on Entrapta while the ship was malfunctioning due to the lack of fuel. Darla discovered the crystals needed for fuel on a nearby planet. Once on the planet, the ground collapsed under Adora and she fell into a crystalline cavern replete with blue crystals. The&#160;Star Siblings&#160;then attacked Adora without warning but they finally figured out that they were all on the same side and stopped hitting each other.&#160;<a href="/wiki/Starla" title="Starla">Starla</a>&#160;shared her food with Adora and introduced her sister,&#160;<a href="/wiki/Tallstar" title="Tallstar">Tallstar</a>, her brother,&#160;<a href="/wiki/Jewelstar" title="Jewelstar">Jewelstar</a>&#160;and her pet owl,&#160;<a href="/wiki/Glory" title="Glory">Glory</a>. The Siblings revealed that they are after the same thulite crystals that Adora is looking for but the constant earthquakes have blocked the way. When Bow, Glimmer and Entrapta joined up the whole gang pressed on to get the thulite. Everyone worked together, learned to trust a bit more and got the thulite. During a tremor, Adora summoned She-Ra to save them from a collapse, which Swift Wind felt though their sacred bond. Everyone shared the crystals and the Star Siblings vowed to help fight Prime in any way they could.

<p>Once back on Darla Adora then asked to go back and save Catra; Bow and Glimmer agreed to save her "Best Friends Style". Adora piloted Darla, Mara's ship, to Prime's space station with Glimmer, Bow and Entrapta hidden outside the ship in space suits. She surrendered herself for capture upon touchdown. While the clones took Adora to Prime the other three split up, communicating with radio-enabled earpieces. In Prime's throne room Adora tried to bargain with Prime using the threat of the Heart of Etheria. Prime called her bluff, saying that she would never do anything to harm Catra. He then revealed that he is centuries old, he crushed the First Ones and knows that Adora is a First One. Prime then revealed Catra, who was under his control thanks to a <a href="/wiki/Horde_Chip" title="Horde Chip">chip</a> implanted in her neck. He left the two women and they began to fight. Prime's connection to Catra began to weaken thanks to Adora damaging her chip but Prime still managed to make Catra critically injure herself. Surrounded by clones a grief-stricken Adora was able to summon her true She-Ra form and defeated them single handily. She-Ra rejoined the group with an unconscious Catra. They boarded Darla and escaped. She-Ra used her powers to heal Catra's injuries.

<p>On board the ship, Adora attempted to reconnect with Catra but was annoyed at how stubborn she still was. When they were attacked by Horde ships, Adora realized that they were tracking them trough Catra's chip so she brought bought Entrapta to Catra's room to remove the chip. Catra was reluctant at first but finally agreed as she beg Adora to stay with her. When Adora learned that Prime has chipping people on Etheria thanks to Catra's visions from her chip, she was more determined than ever to return home and save everyone. She transformed into She-Ra and destroyed the Horde ships in a spectacular space battle. After the ship was repaired Adora and her friends were just astonished that She-Ra was back. As they were eating and impressed with Glimmer's cooking, Catra entered the bridge and they welcomed her to join them, as Catra and Adora smiled at each other.
</p><p>Adora later practices transforming into She-Ra but, but keeps getting distracted by her friends. Later when they are in the transmission range of Etheria they contacted Perfuma who warned them it was not safe to come back because the rebellion had been compromised and the Horde had a blockade surrounding the planet.

<p>Adora and the others try to figure out how to bypass the blockade and if Horde Prime had a weakness to exploit when <a href="/wiki/Wrong_Hordak" title="Wrong Hordak">Wrong Hordak</a> accidentally reveals that Prime does have a weakness that can be found on <a href="/wiki/Krytis" title="Krytis">Krytis</a>. Arriving there, they find that the planet is in ruins. When Entrapta's scanners pick up a heat signature Adora decides they should start looking for the mystery life-form. While searching though an abandoned spire many strange things start happening from a wall attacking the group to a door mysteriously appearing. Entrapta informs the group that she discovered that the First Ones and Horde Prime fought over Krytis and Horde Prime was victorious, but something drove him off the planet Then the life-form made itself known and separated Catra from the group. The walls begin attacking again, but Glimmer discovers it was just illusions. When they find Catra, Adora and the others find her petting the creature. After Catra explains the situation to Adora, she and her fiends learn trough Catra's translations that the creature's name was <a href="/wiki/Melog" title="Melog">Melog</a>, it's the last of its kind the First Ones were mining for Krytis' magic just like on Etheria, and that magic itself is Horde Prime's weakness. Adora invites Melog to come with them to Etheria and thanks to Catra's suggestion had Melog use it's magic to cloak the ship and go through the Horde blockade.

<p>Glimmer and crew returned to Etheria and found the rebel base in ruins. They decided to gather intel and so Glimmer teleported everyone to&#160;Erelandia&#160;which they find out is guarded by bots and clones. Entrapta, Bow, Glimmer, Catra and Adora followed Wrong Hordak into the village in disguise. The heroes tried to question the village folk but the locals were too scared to answer questions, except for one shopkeeper who tells the hero's that the Rebellion has joined the Horde and that Princesses attacked the town. Just then Spinnerella landed in the village and attacked the heroes. After trading blows and pleas to stop the attack, Netossa joined and began defending the town from Spinnerella. Rather than risking hurting their chipped friend <a href="/wiki/Glimmer" title="Glimmer">Glimmer</a> teleported everyone away from the fight. Netossa saw Catra and instantly attacked, trapping her in a net. She had the same reaction to Wrong Hordak. She then explained the amount of damage done, all the <a href="/wiki/Princesses" title="Princesses">Princesses</a> and friends who were now under Prime's control. Glimmer and the rest returned to Erelandia, and using Wrong Hordak to draw out two clones defeating them. Next they began an assault on the enemies inside the village. She-Ra and Netossa attacked Spinnerella while the rest handled the bots. While fighting her wife, the conflict became too great for Spinnerella and the chip grew in strength, hurting her and she fled. With the Horde purged from the village, the citizens pledged themselves to the Rebellion. &#160;Netossa led everyone to the hideout. And there was a joyous reunion. Unfortunately Frosta saw Catra and downed her with an ice-haymaker before being told that she'd switched sided. Adora pledged to free all their friends and defeat Prime.
</p><p>Inside the rebel base,&#160;Adora&#160;leads a planning session on how to stop the chipped&#160;Princesses.&#160;Netossa&#160;revealed everyone's weaknesses in an effort to do that. They lost track of&#160;Spinnerella&#160;but found out that&#160;Scorpia&#160;returned to the&#160;Fright Zone.&#160;Catra&#160;pointed out the best way to save their friends is to first damage the chip. Adora made a plan to sneak into Scorpia's home.&#160;Glimmer&#160;and&#160;Bow&#160;agreed to check up on his dads as Bow was really worried about them. Netossa,&#160;Perfuma, Adora, Catra sneaked into the Fright Zone, cloaked by&#160;Melog. Perfuma walked in calling out to Scorpia, forgetting what stealth means. This got her attention and she attacked her friends.
</p><p>As the <a href="/wiki/Princesses" title="Princesses">Princesses</a> fought in the Fright Zone, Scorpia forced Adora and Perfuma into Horak's throne room that Prime had taken over and remade in his image. Scorpia bound the two Princesses while Prime explained that he had to come and see <a href="/wiki/Etheria" title="Etheria">Etheria</a> for himself. He revealed that he no longer needed She-Ra to activate the <a href="/wiki/Heart_of_Etheria" title="Heart of Etheria">Heart of Etheria</a>; building upon Hordak's research and his personal knowledge of the <a href="/wiki/First_Ones" title="First Ones">First Ones</a> he said that he could access the Heart on his own. Horde Prime ordered Scorpia to end Adora and <a href="/wiki/Perfuma" title="Perfuma">Perfuma</a>, and she powered up her lightning and devastated the platform that Adora and Perfuma were on. But that only released the Princesses and angered Prime. After escaping Prime, Adora and Perfuma found <a href="/wiki/Glimmer" title="Glimmer">Glimmer</a> who teleported them back to their base.

When they reached the Luminarium Catra broke stealth mode alerting the sorcerer's to their presence and a brief fight ensued with one sorcerer. Shadow Weaver opened the secret entrance within <a href="/wiki/Mystacor" title="Mystacor">Mystacor</a>. After bickering with Shadow Weaver in the tunnel Adora triggered a fire rune that erupted in fake flames around her. Catra jumped into the fire and 'saved' Adora. <a href="/wiki/Shadow_Weaver" title="Shadow Weaver">Shadow Weaver</a> then tried and failed, to drive a wedge between Adora and Catra by falsely claiming that her friendship, her love was what was preventing her from being able to summon She-Ra. Upon reaching the fail-safe, which was inside a giant crystal tower, Shadow Weaver instructed Adora to open it with the password "Friends of Mara". The instructions inside said, "Someone needs to go inside and accept the fail-safe"; which means that someone must take the fail-safe and carry it bodily into the Heart. Since She-Ra was the only one who could absorb the full power of the Heart only she could go, despite Catra's and everyone else's protestations. Knowing that she may not survive she decided her sacrifice would be better than <a href="/wiki/Prime" class="mw-redirect" title="Prime">Prime</a> getting access to the Heart. But Micah showed up with two other chipped sorcerers and a fight erupted. Using the fight as a distraction Adora entered and accepted the fail-safe. <a href="/wiki/Micah" title="Micah">Micah</a> used dark magic to entrap the heroes and he tried to interrupt Adora's accepting of the fail-safe. Seeing her friends in distress she summoned She-Ra, accepted the fail-safe and bound <a href="/wiki/Micah" title="Micah">Micah</a> and the two sorcerers. Everyone fled <a href="/wiki/Mystacor" title="Mystacor">Mystacor</a> for their base where <a href="/wiki/Entrapta" title="Entrapta">Entrapta</a> worked on her computer. <a href="/wiki/Catra" title="Catra">Catra</a> was so upset at seeing Adora's willingness to sacrifice herself that she left with <a href="/wiki/Melog" title="Melog">Melog</a> rather than see Adora leave her again.
</p><p>The remnants of&#160;the Rebellion&#160;are gathered and happily talking when&#160;Adora&#160;transforms into&#160;She-Ra&#160;and comes before them. She gives an assessment of the dangers should&#160;Horde Prime&#160;gain&#160;the Heart, and their situation, with most of their friends and allies chipped and under Horde Prime's strengthening control. However,&#160;Entrapta&#160;has an idea to broadcast a jamming frequency to block out Horde Prime's connection to the chips, deactivating them and freeing everyone from Horde Prime's control. She-Ra's plan is for everyone present to get Entrapta to the Horde's spire and keep Horde forces at bay while Entrapta works, with She-Ra herself going to the Heart of Etheria to use the fail-safe.
</p><p>She leaves the base just as the She-Ra form flickers and dies, turning her fully back into Adora. As this happens,&#160;Bow&#160;and&#160;Glimmer&#160;come after her and assure her that they will accompany her to the Heart, which cheers her enough to be able to recall the She-Ra form once again. Together, they all go to the&#160;Crystal Castle. &#160;After going to the spire a battle rages, the Best Friends Squad continues into the earth toward the Heart of Etheria, plagued by visions of Catra, created of She-Ra's own wants and desires. She-Ra resolves to not be distracted, even as her form flickers between She-Ra and Adora again. She fears that she will lose She-Ra and die in the process of activating the fail-safe if she cannot control her emotions, and so forges on ahead alone, barely in control of her She-Ra form as it flickers and fades.
</p><p>Catra and Shadow Weaver transport with the sorcerers magic to support Adora. She-Ra finds herself in yet another illusory landscape, looking out over a healthy, healed Etheria incongruent with the real world.&#160;Adora has a discussion with Mara while in this state. However, the conversation is interrupted by the holographic arrival of Horde Prime, the illusion fraying at the edges with bursts of static as he assumes command of the First Ones infrastructure around them. &#160;Prime commands a First Ones guardian to attack She-Ra, infecting her with the same virus he used to assume control of the other&#160;First Ones technology&#160;and forcing her back into her Adora form. Horde Prime then departs, bidding goodbye to his "oldest enemy" as a&#160;horrible monster&#160;appears.
</p><p>With&#160;Horde Prime&#160;having turned the&#160;First Ones&#160;defense systems against Adora and severely wounding her, Catra holds off a First Ones'&#160;guardian&#160;while Shadow Weaver ushers Adora toward the&#160;Heart of Etheria&#160;to activate the fail-safe. &#160;Shadow Weaver arrives with Adora at the Heart of Etheria, and begins to feel the pulsing magic there, magic that she could assume for herself and finally be restored to power. However, Adora hears Catra scream and turns back, leaving Shadow Weaver faced with a difficult choice - the magic, or Catra.
</p><p>Just as Catra is about to be eaten, a blast of dark magic thunders out of the tunnel and knocks the guardian back, freeing Catra. Surrounded by the power of her own life magic, Shadow Weaver launches blast after devastating blast of dark power at the guardian, holding it at bay long enough for her to ensnare it in a rope of magic. However, Catra did not listen to her warning to take Adora and run, so Shadow Weaver blasts Catra back into the tunnel with Adora and raises a barrier to keep her there. Shadow Weaver begs Catra to leave and get Adora. Catra fears that the effort will kill her, but Shadow Weaver accepts that it is too late for her and tells Catra how proud she is of both Catra and Adora. As Adora arrives, Shadow Weaver removes her mask and looks on at the two women. Just before unleashing the last of her magic, she smiles and tells them "you're welcome", at which point she explodes in a blast of magic that kills her and the guardian. &#160;Sobbing, they leave behind Shadow Weaver's shattered mask and make for the Heart of Etheria.
</p><p>
Catra carries Adora to the Heart of Etheria. Adora prepares to become She-Ra to destroy it, but is unable to do so due to the infection setting into her wounds from Horde Prime's virus. Adora knows that the fail-safe will work with or without She-Ra, however, she'll simply die in the process if she uses it in her normal form. She makes peace with it and prepares to sacrifice herself, but Catra refuses to leave, and stays with her as she goes to her death. Meanwhile, Adora passes out and has a daydream of what could be, she and Catra about to get married later in life, surrounded by old friends Glimmer and Bow. However, Horde Prime appears in the daydream and derides it as "a beautiful wish" that she will never have. However, Catra calls out to her and professes her love for her, so Adora wakes up and is suddenly able to summon a shield to protect them both from a surge of power from the Heart of Etheria. She dispels it, professes her own love for Catra in return, kisses her, and then transforms into She-Ra at last.</p><figure class="thumb tright show-info-icon" style="width: 252px"> 	<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/shera-and-the-princesses-of-power/images/4/41/CatradoraKiss.gif/revision/latest?cb=20200611232936" class="image"><img alt="" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" width="250" height="141" class="thumbimage lazyload" data-image-name="CatradoraKiss.gif" data-image-key="CatradoraKiss.gif" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/shera-and-the-princesses-of-power/images/4/41/CatradoraKiss.gif/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20200611232936" /></a> 	<noscript><a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/shera-and-the-princesses-of-power/images/4/41/CatradoraKiss.gif/revision/latest?cb=20200611232936" class="image"><img alt="" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/shera-and-the-princesses-of-power/images/4/41/CatradoraKiss.gif/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20200611232936" decoding="async" width="250" height="141" class="thumbimage" data-image-name="CatradoraKiss.gif" data-image-key="CatradoraKiss.gif" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/shera-and-the-princesses-of-power/images/4/41/CatradoraKiss.gif/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20200611232936" /></a></noscript> 	<figcaption class="thumbcaption"> 		 			<a href="/wiki/File:CatradoraKiss.gif" class="info-icon"><svg><use xlink:href="#wds-icons-info-small"></use></svg></a> 		 		 		 			<p class="caption">Adora &amp; Catra confessing their love</p> 		 	</figcaption> </figure><p>As she transforms, the fail-safe is finally activated, destroying the Heart of Etheria the First Ones created sending the magic thundering back to the princesses. This halts the destructive wave of energy that was tearing up the planet's crust just before it reaches the princesses who were cowering before the previously chipped Etherians. She-Ra arrives, using the restored Etherian magic to heal the damage done to the planet's crust, covering it in greenery while also transforming Horde Prime's massive command ship into a tree floating in space. She-Ra then comes before Horde Prime who vows he will return, only for She-Ra to correct him saying his reign is over and banishes him from Hordak's body with a surge of magic, killing him, ending the threat of the Horde once and for all.
</p><p>Adora&#160;and&#160;Catra&#160;embrace, glad that everything is finally over, and they along with Bow and Glimmer lay on the grass. Bow ask what are they going to to now and Adora vows to bring magic back to the universe; proposing a "Best Friends Squad&#160;Road Trip" all of which happily agree.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Trivia">Trivia</span></h2>
<ul><li>In the 1985 TV original series, Adora was the twin sister of Prince Adam (He-Man) of the house of Grayskull on Eternia. While both Eternia and <a href="/wiki/Grayskull" title="Grayskull">Grayskull</a> are referenced in this series, there's no hint to confirm that Adam even exists. The "female-equivalent" to Adam in this continuity is <a href="/wiki/Mara" title="Mara">Mara</a>.</li>
<li>Promotional images released in the lead up to the <a href="/wiki/Season_One" title="Season One">Season One</a> premiere caused a massive stir on the Internet. The images in question were of Adora transformed as <a href="/wiki/She-Ra_(line)" title="She-Ra (line)">She-Ra</a>. The accusation was that the crew were attempting to de-feminize Adora by giving her a more modest costume with shorts and overall reducing the design from the 80's sex appeal.</li>
<li>Adora doesn't even try to hide the fact that she and She-Ra are the same person and everyone, including her enemies, knows this. When transformed, She-Ra's personality is the same as Adora's.</li>
<li>Adora's astrological sign is Capricorn, also known as the horned goat.</li>
<li>Adora's first act as Force Captain was to steal/"borrow" a skiff.</li>
<li>Adora was seen to sleep with a knife under her pillow. Furthermore, she dislikes having her weapons taken away from her as seen in "<a href="/wiki/Princess_Prom" title="Princess Prom">Princess Prom</a>".</li>
<li>Adora is the only character to appear in all the episodes of the series.</li>
<li>Adora is only one of two people on Etheria who are not from Etheria, the other is <a href="/wiki/Hordak" title="Hordak">Hordak</a>.</li>
<li>Adora is the second She-Ra to use the <a href="/wiki/Sword_of_Protection" title="Sword of Protection">Sword of Protection</a>, since <a href="/wiki/Mara" title="Mara">Mara</a> was the first.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Noelle_Stevenson" title="Noelle Stevenson">Noelle Stevenson</a> created two playlists called <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1B7wht1JPHX5CcL5YrQRN1?si=_09-sVEjRueEKdCJglPiGA">"Adora"</a> and also <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/01OnI7jvLmwytocOt3NzUV?si=WQ2MDvLMT4iZ7VhS6EiylA">"She-Ra"</a> on Spotify, along with a few other of the main characters. These playlists seem to have songs that <a href="/wiki/Noelle_Stevenson" title="Noelle Stevenson">Stevenson</a> identifies with the characters, or about their feelings throughout the show. The "She-Ra" playlist may include themes for a lot of the characters, or for the show's themes itself instead of just a playlist centred around the character <a href="/wiki/She-Ra_(line)" title="She-Ra (line)">She-Ra</a> (seeing as Adora already has a playlist).</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Noelle_Stevenson" title="Noelle Stevenson">Stevenson</a> also tweeted that <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://twitter.com/Gingerhazing/status/1204485289298644992">in terms of Hogwarts houses</a>, Adora is a "Slytherin trying to be a Gryffindor."</li>
<li>"Adora's original (and first) <a href="/wiki/She-Ra_(line)" title="She-Ra (line)">She-ra form</a> was like this uncomfortable suit she has to wear. She never really feels at home in the original She-Ra form," <a href="/wiki/Stevenson" class="mw-redirect" title="Stevenson">Stevenson</a> tells EW. "It combined the militaristic aspect of Adora’s upbringing in the Horde with the role She-Ra has with the <a href="/wiki/First_Ones" title="First Ones">First Ones</a>. There's the top that’s buttoned up, the large pointy shoulder blades, and then these elements of femininity that Adora is very uncomfortable with: The skirt, the tiara, the long flowing hair. She’s really trying to fit this version of She-Ra, but it’s not her. She’s never comfortable in that form" (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="https://ew.com/tv/she-ra-interview-adora-new-look/">https://ew.com/tv/she-ra-interview-adora-new-look/</a>).</li></ul>
